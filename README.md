# DL
To put on record some fundamental Deep Learning methods I've learned & implemented

- DCGAN, SAGAN
  - spectral norm, self-attention, wasserstein loss, visualization of attention maps
- (Multivariate) Time-series Classification (for Anomaly detection, & Prediction)
  - LSTM
  - LSTM-FCN
  - Ensemble models/methods
  - EDA: self-defined classes/labels, self-engineered features, feature visualization, hyperparameter tuning methods, etc.
  - "Live" training & testing simulation

(to be updated)
